# AetherChain

A transparent supply chain tracking system for luxury goods built on the Stacks blockchain.

## Features

- Product registration with unique identifiers
- Transfer of ownership tracking
- Product authentication verification
- Full history of product movement

## How it works

The contract allows manufacturers to register luxury products with unique identifiers and track their movement through the supply chain. Each transfer of ownership is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of the product's journey from manufacturer to end customer.

Authorized dealers can be registered by manufacturers to facilitate legitimate sales and transfers. The system provides verification methods to confirm product authenticity and ownership status.
